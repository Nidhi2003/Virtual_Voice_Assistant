# Virtual_Voice_Assistant
Main objective of building personal assistant software (a virtual assistant) 
is using semantic data sources available on the web, user generated content and providing knowledge from knowledge databases.
The main purpose of an intelligent virtual assistant is to answer questions that users may have.
This may be done in a business environment, for example, on the business website, with a chat interface.
Virtual assistants can tremendously save you time. We spend hours in online research and then making the report in our terms
of understanding.
                                               
One of the main advantages of voice searches is their rapidity. 
In fact, voice is reputed to be four times faster than a written search: whereas we can write 
about 40 words per minute, we are capable of speaking around 150 during the same period of time15. 
In this respect, the ability of personal assistants to accurately recognize spoken words are a prerequisite for them to be adopted by consumers

# Methodology of Virtual Assistant Using Python
# Speech Recognition module
The system uses Google’s online speech recognition system for converting speech input to text.
The speech input Users can obtain texts from the special corpora organised on the computer network server at the information 
centre from the microphone is temporarily stored in the system which is then sent to Google cloud for speech recognition. 
The equivalent text is then received and fed to the central processor.
# Python Backend:
The python backend gets the output from the speech recognition module and then identifies whether the command or the speech output
is an API Call and Context Extraction. The output is then sent back to the python backend to give the required output to the user.
# API calls
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
In other words, an API is a messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you’re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.
# Content Extraction
Context extraction (CE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents.
In most cases, this activity concerns processing human language texts using natural language processing (NLP).
Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of
images/audio/video could be seen as context extraction TEST RESULTS.
# Text-to-speech module
Text-to-Speech (TTS) refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud.
A TTS Engine converts written text to a phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound.
TTS engines with different languages, dialects and specialised vocabularies are available through third-party publishers.
